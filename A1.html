                <h2>These are some of the reasons that is causing poverty:</h2>
                <p><ol>
                    <li>The growth rate being 2.62% when it already has 133 million people.
                    </li>
                    <li>Also, the economy revolves around agriculture. So, if a natural disaster is happening it will affect the people so
                    much.li>
                    <li>There was a civil war between Ethiopia and Tigray region. This war was an armed conflict that lasted 2 years.</</li>
                </ol></p>
            </article>
            <aside>
                <p>First of all, we need some money for fixing our damages caused by natural disasters and civil wars. We also need
                teachers from worldwide to teach our students so, in the future we will have bright future. We are also planning to
                build more schools.
                <br>
                Secondly since, our agriculture is our main resource we seek money to expand it and trade them internationally with the
                help of planes because we’re landlocked.
                <br>
                Next, even though we get tons of helps from United States, the European Union, individual European nations, Japan, the
                People's Republic of China, the World Bank, and the African Development Bank, we still need help from other countries as
                well. <br>
                Finally, health insurances for our people would be helpful. We want our people to feel safe.
